Description
========================

This scene aims to bring a robot that does not have odometry (encoder on its wheels). The Robot is equipped with a LaserScan sensor and an RGB camera. The goal is to use the scene to study localization techniques that do not involve the use of encoder odometry, such as hector_slam.No TF is created to simulate the situation where the robot only navigates through the Lidar, without the need for base_link and other frames.
